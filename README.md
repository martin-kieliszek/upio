### Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

Upio ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

#### Information We Collect

**None.** Upio does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.

#### Data Storage

All data generated by Upio is stored locally on your device:
- Exercise logs (date, time, exercise type, count)
- Custom exercises you create
- Achievement progress
- Notification preferences and schedules
- Statistics and analytics

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any servers.

#### No Account Required

Upio does not require you to create an account. There is no user registration, login system, or cloud synchronization.

#### Third-Party Services

Upio does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

#### Notifications

The app uses local notifications to remind you to exercise. These notifications are generated entirely on your device and do not involve any external servers.

#### iCloud (Optional)

If you enable iCloud backup on your device, your iOS system may back up the app's data as part of your device backup. This is controlled by your device's iCloud settings, not by the app.

#### Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID). We recommend keeping your device secured.

#### Children's Privacy

Upio does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is designed to work entirely offline without any data collection.

#### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on the App Store.

#### Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the App Store.
